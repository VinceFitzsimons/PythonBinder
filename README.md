# PythonBinder
A platform for running Python code via web.

This area includes some Python Interactive Notebooks (which have the ipynb file tail) and should run via the web.  If there are difficulties, they can be copied to your own machine.  Then install Anaconda (which has a piece of software called Jupyter in i - that runs these notebooks).
